### Hi there
I am Ikbal 🐈

- I am a software engineer specialising in mobile app development. Android more specifically but I also have written iOS apps too.

- I do care about simplicity, consistency and reliability in any software component.

- I do care about strong typing and strong tooling. Strong typing creates ability to create more solid foundations. strong tooling helps those foundations grow wiser.
 
-  I am interested in concurrency and am learning language features and communication mechanisms in different languages, specifically JVM based ones.Java and Kotlin.
